The library will be be uploaded in a few days.  I am completing an application that uses the library so it can be continuously tested.   

IN FACT - I was tested... because a few wanted to know how well the multi-mixer design works if it did have a TRACK INTERFACE.  

Just for PREVIEW purposes... the Actual software being used now is the zip folder.  Its called nHarmony.  You can view info about it on the links. and thru wiki!  

See you in a few days.
